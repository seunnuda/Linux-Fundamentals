# **Linux-Fundamentals**
Excelling in today's tech fields like DevOps, Cloud Computing, Software Development, Cybersecurity, Data Analysis/Science, AI, and QA Testing starts with the basics. This project focuses on Linux, providing the fundamental understanding crucial for any aspiring tech professional.


## **Project Overview**

Embark on a practical journey to master AWS EC2 instance management, starting with an Ubuntu Linux foundation. This project covers everything from bringing an EC2 instance online and securely connecting with MobaXterm, to performing essential Linux tasks and establishing a functional web server using Nginx. Clear, step-by-step instructions are paired with visual aids for optimal understanding.

### **Three Steps to Embark on this Cloud project:**

### **Step 1: Cloud Infrastructure & Operating System Foundation**

- AWS EC2: Begin by leveraging this cloud computing service to provision and launch your virtual server. This forms the foundational infrastructure for the project.

- Ubuntu: Select and deploy this popular Linux distribution as the robust operating system for EC2 instance, providing the environment for all subsequent configurations.

i.AWS Account Creation
  An AWS account is fundamental as it grants immediate access to provision and manage diverse cloud resources, including remote servers (like EC2 instances). This access is essential for secure operations, and gaining practical experience within the vast AWS ecosystem.
